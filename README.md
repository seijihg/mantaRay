# php-js-map-demo

This is a proof of concept for simple mapping tool visualization.

### Development requirements
- no database
- OO PHP
- Bootstrap 4
- use npm for "modules" 
- use Highcharts.js or Leaflet.js  
- first button both generates random data points and creates the area/heatmap. This is passed to the front-end for Map visualisation.
- second button adds each entry dynamically to existing data and updates the Map
- map has a switch button that can toggle between data points and area/heatmap
- all data are represented in a sortable table
- each data point / area on the map can be clicked to show more details

### Process
- copy all files to your own repository
- have fun with writing the code
- commit the code to your repo
- share with us :)
